Projectivity is a Hackaton Project a few friends and I had completed during MRUHACKS2024 Hackathon during the span of 24 hours we:

• Created Projectivity, a productivity tool leveraging the OpenAI API and React Big Calendar to break down tasks
and generate a project schedule, exportable to third-party calendar apps (Google, Apple, Microsoft Calendar).
• Led a team in overcoming technical hurdles, including a pivot from Flask to Node.js for compatibility with the
React front-end, showcasing adaptability and problem-solving under pressure.
• Implemented task automation features by integrating ICS file export, enabling users to easily manage project
timelines across different platforms.
